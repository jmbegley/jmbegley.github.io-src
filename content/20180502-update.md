Summary: Website update May 2018

This is a long overdue update to my website. A lack of activity on here either means I haven't been doing anything that is putting on the internet, or that I've been too busy doing other stuff to put stuff on the internet. I'll leave it to you to judge which ...

In 2016 Estelle and I visited Cambodia and Thailand for 3 weeks, worked at Glastonbury, spent a week caving in the Yorkshire Dales, a week diving in Lanzarote and bought a campervan. In 2017 we went to the Dolomites twice (once to go skiing and once to play on the via ferrata) and took our campervan for a week caving in Ireland and a week exploring Shetland, along with another week working at Glastonbury.

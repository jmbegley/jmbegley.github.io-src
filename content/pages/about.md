## Who am I?

I am a forty-something mathematician and computer programmer who works in Bristol and lives on the Mendips in Somerset with my wonderful partner Estelle. Please see my [CV](/pages/james-begley-cv.html) page for more details about my career to date.

## What do I like to do?

Outside work, Estelle and I enjoy a number of outdoor activities but caving in particular (it's no coincidence that we live in one of the UK's caving regions!). I'm an active member and journal editor of [Shepton Mallet Caving Club](https://www.shepton.org.uk), a local caving club through which I have enjoyed several expeditions to explore new caves in remote areas of Iceland and Thailand. I'm also a rescue warden and webmaster for [Mendip Cave Rescue](https://www.mendipcaverescue.org), the local voluntary cave rescue service. We also enjoy many other outdoor activities, including skiing, cycling and running.

When I'm not outside burning calories, I'm often in the kitchen cooking something to replace them. When we moved to our house, we were doubtful that we would make much use of the Aga that came with the house, but we have come to really enjoy cooking with it. It's a very relaxing way to cook.

My home computer is running [Fedora](https://getfedora.org), a variant of Linux. This website has been written using pelican, with the content written in markdown. All the configuration files, plugins and markdown files are stored in a [Github](https://github.com/jmbegley/jmbegley.github.io-src) repository.
